I'm excited to officially launch Version 1.0.0 of my full-stack MERN blog web application! (Deployed April 4, 2025)

This marks the first production-ready release of the app, now deployed and live using:

Frontend: React (with TypeScript), hosted on Vercel
Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB, deployed on Render
Database: MongoDB Atlas

🛠️ Key Features in v1.0.0:

🧑‍💻 User Registration & Login (with JWT authentication)
🔐 Passwords securely hashed using bcryptjs
📝 Create and manage blog posts (with optional image upload)
📦 REST API for user and post management
🎨 Responsive frontend styled with Tailwind CSS
🛡️ CORS-enabled backend to support secure frontend/backend communication

⚠️ About Backend Cold Starts

Due to the use of free tier development and deployment tools in this app, you may experience slight delays known as 'backend cold starts'. This happens when the server needs to wake up from an inactive state, common in free service tiers to conserve resources. I am using free tiers across services like MongoDB Atlas for the database, Render for backend deployment, and Vercel for frontend hosting. This efficient use of resources helps keep the app accessible at no extra cost but may lead to temporary latency. I appreciate your patience and understanding.

⚠️ Note:

This is an early production release. More features and refinements are actively being worked on — including:

Post editing
User profile customization
Improved editor experience with formatting options
