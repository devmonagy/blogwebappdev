I'm excited to officially launch Version 1.0.0 of my full-stack MERN blog web application! (Deployed April 4, 2025)

This marks the first production-ready release of the app, now deployed and live using:

Frontend: React (with TypeScript), hosted on Vercel
Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB, deployed on Render
Database: MongoDB Atlas

🛠️ Key Features in v1.0.0:
🧑‍💻 User Registration & Login (with JWT authentication)
🔐 Passwords securely hashed using bcryptjs
📝 Create and manage blog posts (with optional image upload)
📦 REST API for user and post management
🎨 Responsive frontend styled with Tailwind CSS
🛡️ CORS-enabled backend to support secure frontend/backend communication

⚠️ Note:
This is an early production release. More features and refinements are actively being worked on — including:

Post editing
User profile customization
Improved editor experience with formatting options
